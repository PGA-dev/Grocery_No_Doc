# Grocery_No_Doc

## PGA
### Purpose
This is a new approach to my Portfolio Project using the REST API Framework from Django. The use of Hyperlinked Serializers and Generic View approaches makes the new model more extensible, and much more flexible to modern web API programming. The Name for this project was a working joke, as the project was a practice that I did not yet set up as a Docker project; though this will be remedied in the future.
